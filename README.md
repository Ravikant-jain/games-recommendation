# Game Recommendation using Apriori Theorem

## Overview
This Python script utilizes the Apriori algorithm to generate game recommendations based on transaction data. It employs a randomly generated transaction dataset stored in a JSON file and fetches game names from another JSON file named `games.json`.

## Features
- **Apriori Algorithm**: Utilizes the Apriori theorem to analyze transactional data and recommend games.
- **Randomly Generated Transactions**: The script uses a randomly generated transaction dataset for analysis.
- **Game Database**: Fetches game names from `games.json` to provide recommendations.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.11
## Usage
- Ensure the `transactions.json` file contains the transactional data.
- Confirm that `games.json` holds the database of game names.
- Run the script to generate game recommendations based on the provided transaction data.
